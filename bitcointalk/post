[center]Our team has been developing blockchain applications and cryptocurrencies since 2015. We carefully monitor the development of popular ecosystems and new technologies. Studying the details of various blockchain architectures, we were able to identify the most promising platforms with processing up to 100,000 transactions per second. Now we want to bring to your attention a new system of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with excellent performance and a convenient functional interface. It is planned to conduct large and complex work on the introduction of universal blockchain solutions.[/center]

     We must warn immediately that we adhere to the ideology laid down by Satoshi Nakamoto himself about decentralization, anonymity and security of all network users, denying and preventing any regulation and identification. Therefore, in parallel, we will develop and integrate Onion TOR and l2p networks to provide a multi-level proxy. The decentralized currency exchanger CREX is now open for full beta testing. Our DEX works on the Bitshares blockchain platform, thus allowing you to interact with already operating exchanges and gateways (openledger, xbtsx, rudex etc.). Even your accounts and their keys can easily be transferred with all balances saved. 

     So that those who wish can support our aspirations and ideas for the development of the platform, we launched the crowdsale ERC20 token called CREXO. Crowdsale is built on Ethereum smart contracts. The maximum amount cannot exceed 10,000,000 CREXO. The purchase price is only 0.0005 ETH (1 ETH = 2000 CREXO). You can take part in the crowdsale and purchase CREXO tokens on this page http://ico.crex.online. You must have the Metamask browser extension installed (you can install it here http://metamask.io). CREXO purchase is automated. (To speed up the transaction, you can increase the cost of GAS in the Ethereum network. After completing the distribution of CREXO tokens by crowdsale, you will be able to enter CREXO into your personal account directly on DEX (crex.online). After the crowdsale, you can use CREXO to create a personal asset an instant listing on the DEX platform. You can also replenish the vesting account and periodically receive dividends from the profits of the CREX exchange. You can also sell or exchange your CREXO asset on the CREX.online market. 

     The funds received as a result of your support of the CREX project during the crowdsale will be distributed to pay for servers to ensure a stable and fast connection to any region in the world. As part of the funds will provide freelancers who help in the development of decentralized applications and expanding the functionality of DEX. A certain amount of funds will be used to secure the CREXO asset, which will prevent the price from falling below its initial value.[/size][size=100]For your convenience, we will provide a free trading bot with customizable trading tactics. In the future, we will open the opportunity to leave an application for adding cryptocurrencies with other blockchain technologies.
